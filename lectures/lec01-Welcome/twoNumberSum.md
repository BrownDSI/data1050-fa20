Below is an example of a typical coding interview problem.<hr>

TWO NUMBER SUM

1. Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. 
1. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order. 
1. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.
1. You can assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum.

Note: the target sum has to be obtained by summing two
different numbers in the array, i.e., you can't add an array element to itself to obtain the target sum.

What does this problem statement tell you?

---
We're now going to code the solution to this problem.

---
Using the `twoNumberSum-prob.py` problem stencil:

`twoNumberSum-prob.py`

The code at the bottom defines a test case.  Let's talk about that and then get going.

---
What does `set` do? <hr>
What does `assert` do? <hr>

___
### Logistics
* Put a copy of the stencil in `~/data1050-fa20/lec01-Welcome/twoNumberSum-prob.py`

* You'll need to create this directory
* Put your solution in `~/data1050-fa20/lec01-Welcome/twoNumberSum-prob.py`

If you are ready, go for it! <hr>
If not, the TAs and I are standing by. <hr>

When you are done, please paste your solution into Prismia chat.
