Welcome to the DATA 1050 Prismia chat! If you want to read about how Prismia works, you can thumb through the feature walk-through. The TL;DR is that class will present as a chat between you and the instructional staff. Your messages may be starred or shared by the instructor with everyone in the class.

Class will begin on September 10, 2020 at 1 PM EST. I look forward to seeing you then!
