Solve the following problem using Test-First Design (TFD):

> Write a function `gap(x,y)` that returns the distance 
  between two numbers?  Use only `if` statements and not 
  functions like `abs` or `max`. 

Follow the TFD Steps (below) in order, and document the result of each step.

**Test-First Design Steps**  
`**Think before you code**`   
1. Inputs - what are arguments?  
2. Outputs - what should be returned?  
3. Usual cases  
4. Special cases   
5. Create **function specification** (signature + docstring)  
6. Implement tests for each case
7. Implement function  
8. add/improve tests as needed
